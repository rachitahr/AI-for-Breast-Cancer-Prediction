# AI-for-Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Many efforts are being made towards application Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve medical problems, drug discovery, disease prediction and improve health care for betterment of society. Medical imaging is widely practiced technique to look interior of a body for clinical analysis and medical intervention, as well as for visual recognition of functioning of internal organs. Physicians look for characteristic features in these images to make decision. Imaging techniques are CT scan, Ultrasound, MRI, X-ray, Mammogram, EEG and ECG etc. Use of artificial intelligence, pre-trained models to identify cues in images and make a decision of suspicious type, reduces valuable man-hours and improve speed, enhance patient care and treatment. 
Current project involves analysis of medical images for predicting breast cancer from mammograms and ultrasound images available publicly. Project work is subdivided into 2 major tasks, one is to build a model to understand usefulness of features in CBIS-DDSM dataset, second to build a deep learning model for breast cancer ultrasound images, ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7210613/110750291-b37ed280-825b-11eb-9a3b-ec4334617dae.png)
